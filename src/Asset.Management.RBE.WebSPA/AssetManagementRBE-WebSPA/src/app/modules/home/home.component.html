<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<h3>Welcome to your new Road Building Equipment: Asset Management Web Application</h3>

<p><strong><code>Note:</code></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong></strong>This App will keep on changing as time goes by as New features are added</li>
  <li><strong>Angular CLI integration</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run <code>ng serve</code>. It runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code>dotnet publish</code> configuration automatically invokes <code>ng build</code> to produce minified, ahead-of-time compiled JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ClientApp</code> subdirectory is a standard Angular CLI application. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run any <code>ng</code> command (e.g., <code>ng test</code>), or use <code>npm</code> to install extra packages into it.</p>
